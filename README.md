# WhatTheHack
This was the workplace for our code (team 9) written for the WhatTheHack 2019, organized by Tobania and Academics For Technology.
No documentation on the code is available since this was a code sprint, though lots of comments are available in the code itself.

## What it is and what it does:
The idea behind this project was to create a system which alows you to find the shortess/best route through a store based on your shopping list and personality type. We implemented a rudimentary front-end, along with a functional backend for a basic implementation of this idea. You can create shopping lists and floorplans for stores along with different aisles carrying certain products. Next the program solves the travelling salesman problem and visualises the route through the store!
